 importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation and model building. Commonly used libraries include Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
 Load the dataset from the Excel file using Pandas.
 Performing data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training. This may involve handling missing values, converting data types, and removing irrelevant columns.
 Scale the numerical features to ensure all features are on a similar scale. StandardScaler from Scikit-learn can be used for this purpose.
 Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. which allows to train the model on a portion of the data and test it on unseen data.
 Train an anomaly detection model on the training data using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is effective for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional datasets.
 Use the trained model to predict anomalies on the test data and evaluate its performance.
